# Time Series Analysis: Johnson & Johnson Quarterly Earnings

This repository contains a time series analysis project that applies ARIMA modeling to Johnson & Johnson's quarterly earnings per share data from 1960 to 1980. The analysis was completed as part of a university coursework in April 2025.

## ðŸ“„ Coursework Summary

- **Dataset**: Johnson & Johnson quarterly earnings per share (EPS), 1960 Q1 â€“ 1980 Q4 (21 years)
- **Goal**: Fit an appropriate ARIMA model to the time series data, evaluate residual diagnostics, and compare models.
- **Approach**:
  - Trend and seasonal analysis using differencing
  - Stationarity checks using ACF/PACF
  - Fitting ARIMA models with and without log transformation
  - Diagnostic checking using residual plots and Shapiro-Wilk test
  - Model selection based on AIC, log-likelihood, and parsimony
